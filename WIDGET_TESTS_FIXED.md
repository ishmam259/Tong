# ✅ Widget Tests Fixed - Tong Messenger

## Problem Identified
The original `widget_test.dart` file had several issues:
- ❌ Imported `hive_flutter` package (not installed)
- ❌ Expected onboarding screen (doesn't exist in current app)
- ❌ Used `const` with non-const constructor
- ❌ Referenced outdated app structure

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Fixed Main Widget Test (`test/widget_test.dart`)
**Replaced outdated test with comprehensive real-world tests:**

| Test | What It Verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `Tong app loads welcome screen` | App starts correctly with welcome screen |
| `Can navigate to messaging screen` | Navigation to main messaging interface |
| `Can access settings screen` | Settings button works and opens settings |
| `Settings screen has all sections` | All settings sections are present |
| `Connection status is displayed` | Networking status shows correctly |

### ✅ Added Network Service Tests (`test/networking_service_test.dart`)
**Unit tests for TCP networking functionality:**

| Test | What It Verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `NetworkingService initializes correctly` | Service starts in correct state |
| `Can start server` | TCP server can be started |
| `Can get local IP address` | Network discovery works |
| `NetworkMessage serialization works` | Message format is correct |
| `Message handler can be set` | Event handling works |
| `Disconnect works without connection` | Error handling is robust |

### ✅ Added Settings Screen Tests (`test/settings_screen_test.dart`)
**Comprehensive UI tests for settings functionality:**

| Test | What It Verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `Settings screen displays all sections` | All UI sections render |
| `Can edit nickname` | Profile editing works |
| `Connection type selection works` | Network options dialog |
| `Network discovery navigation works` | Device discovery screen |
| `Notification toggles work` | Switch controls function |
| `Dark mode toggle works` | Theme switching |
| `Help dialog shows` | Support information |
| `Network discovery initializes` | Device scanning works |
| `Can stop and start scanning` | Scan control buttons |
| `Shows discovered devices` | Mock device results |

```

### Specific Test Files
```bash
flutter test test/widget_test.dart          # Main UI tests
flutter test test/networking_service_test.dart  # Network tests  
flutter test test/settings_screen_test.dart     # Settings tests
```

### With Coverage
```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

## Test Results Expected
